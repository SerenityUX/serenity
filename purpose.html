        <p>What really matters to me?</p>
        <p>Here, I am going to try to refine this to be really specific. It's easy to be general and say you want to "help people", sure everyone does but that's not specific to me and that doesn't tell me anything of what I should be doing.</p>
        <p>What are some things that matter to me?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I care about everyone having a home, somewhere that's their space and they feel comfortable. It makes me incredibly sad to see homeless people, and I wish I could help them get off the streets. It's a complex issue and there's a lot that goes into that happening. I think part of it is just that we as humans should acknowledge that humans have some innate value and part of that value is a right to have a roof to sleep under... even if going through hard time in life. I also believe in taking a shot on people who everyone else disregards.</li>
            <li>I care about everyone having great access to the great beauties of the world. Everyone should get to experience time outside of the city in the woods. There's a lot of peace that I've found there in just step after step enjoying the moment.</li>
            <li>I care about people finding their people. Everyone deserves a community & people they can trust.</li>
            <li>I care about everyone having access to really delicious and healthy food. I think a healthy body is an necessary but not sufficient condition to a healthy mind.</li>
            <li>I care about the things that people do for fun when they're young because I think it shapes the things they do when they're old. I think it's important more kids grow up playing minecraft instead of highly competitive games because Minecraft teachers kids the value of positive sum game and that there's an infite growth that can come through people working together while many other games teach the need to conquer opponents to prove oneself as victor or high-status. I value collaboration, but I don't value competition. I value coming up with fun wacky solutions but I don't value memorization/competitive tests. Minecraft teaches you the way to win is through hard-work and through individual growth.</li>
            <li>I value slow and steady growth over time more than I value sudden spikes in growth. I value more what potential something has than that it is achieving/has achieved.</li>
            <li>I believe in freedom. I belive in people's ability to free themselves from the limits they place on themselves. I belive in people's ability to break addictions that limit their behavior. I believe in people's ability to learn things that they think they're not capable of learning.</li>
            <li>I love animals. I think all living creatures have inherent value. I think that the way animals are farmed in modern farming culture is inhumane and cruel. I think it's cruel that the baby cow is taken away from the mother cow at birth so that the human can drink it's milk. I think it's cruel that the male chickens when they're born are grinded up because they don't have as much economic value as the female chickens. I think it's inhumane that we genetically alter the chickens so they cannot walk and explore but rather have to have unnatural proportions that are desirable for human consumption. I belive animals deserve freedom just as humans deserve freedom. I think the way humans would hunt creatures in the wild with bow & arrow is okay. I think the animal gets to live a good life and it's life has a natural conclusion. It's not for me, I'm not a hunter, but I have respect for them. I see my way of impacting here being really specific and direct and that it's my purchasing decisions where I can have the great impact. I choose to not buy products that don't align with my values, and I believe in capitalism that this sort of supply/demand equation will lead to eventually fewer of these items on the shelves and then fewer of them being produced (decreasing the suffering of animals in the world).</li>
            <li>I'm also a huge believer in intellectual humility and not judging others by the standards you hold yourself to. I don't judge people who disagree with my stance on animals and choose to support the industry. I think they may know something that I don't or they have some different perspective which is equally valuable. I think the best way for me to express my belief is explaining (if asked) why I make the decisions that I do and cooking people food with these ingredients to show it can be delicious too. I don't persuade people and I never want to "convince" or "guilt" someone into thinking the way I do. After all, I may be wrong! All I know is what is truth to me. This isn't about descriptive truths but rather normative truths (the way things "ought" to be, not the way things are)</li>
            <li>I enjoy seeing people smile. I just smile to a stranger as they walk by, and it matters to me that I inspired them to smile back. Little small kindness leads to a better world for all of us and it means a lot to me.</li>
            <li>I care about being a good friend and being "present" for my friends. I want to be there for them when I'm in-person with them and I don't want my mind to be a storm. I want to help them whenever I can.</li>
            <li>I love beautiful design. I love design that makes people "feel something" and think they're capable of something that once seemed impossible. Design comes into color, sound, interactions, motion, etc.</li>
            <li>I care about people getting to experience things that are different from what they've always known. I care about people getting to experience other cultures, other ways of being, other views (even if vastly different from their own). In this way, I value diversity. Diversity of foods that one eats, places one lives, people one meets, etc.</li>
            <li>I love adventures. I love what comes from the unexpected. I love discovering things about the world that I didn't know. I love learning new things.</li>
            <li>I really love to help people grow/learn & I like to grow/learn.</li>
        </ul>
